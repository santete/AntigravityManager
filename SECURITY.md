# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Features

Antigravity Manager takes security seriously. Here are the security measures we've implemented:

### Encryption

- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for all sensitive data (`token_json`, `quota_json`)
- Unique initialization vectors (IV) for each encryption operation
- Authenticated encryption to prevent tampering

### Credential Storage

- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
- **macOS**: macOS Keychain
- **Linux**: Secret Service API / libsecret

Master keys are stored in the OS native credential manager via `keytar`, never in plain text files.

### Data Protection

- Sensitive tokens are encrypted before storage in SQLite database
- Automatic migration of legacy plaintext data on application startup
- No sensitive data is logged or transmitted to external services

# Antigravity Manager

Antigravity Manager is a professional Electron-based application designed to manage multiple cloud AI accounts (Google Gemini / Claude) for the Antigravity application. It provides seamless account switching, real-time quota monitoring, intelligent auto-switching, and comprehensive backup management.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Cloud Account Pool Management**
  - Add unlimited Google Gemini / Claude accounts via OAuth authorization
  - Display account details: avatar, email, status, and last used time
  - Real-time account status monitoring (Active, Rate Limited, Expired)
  - Delete accounts from local database

- **Real-time Quota Monitoring**
  - Multi-model support: Monitor quotas for `gemini-pro`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, etc.
  - Visual display with progress bars and color indicators (green/yellow/red)
  - Auto & manual refresh capabilities

- **Intelligent Auto-Switching**
  - Unlimited pool mode: Automatically find and switch to the best backup account when current quota is low (<5%) or rate-limited
  - Background monitoring: Built-in `CloudMonitorService` polls all accounts every 5 minutes
  - Global toggle: Enable/disable via one-click in the UI

- **One-Click Account Switching**
  - Inject tokens directly into IDE's `state.vscdb` database using Protobuf parsing
  - Graceful process restart to apply new credentials

### Account Backup

- **Backup**: Capture snapshots of your current account state
- **Restore**: Fast and easy switching between multiple saved accounts
- **Management**: View, organize, and delete saved account snapshots

### Process Control

- Automatically detect if Antigravity is running
- Launch Antigravity via URI protocol or executable path
- Gracefully close or force kill the Antigravity process

### System Integration

- **System Tray**: Background mode with tray icon and right-click menu
- **IDE Sync**: Automatically scan and import accounts from IDE's `state.vscdb`
- **Batch Operations**: Batch refresh and delete multiple accounts

### Security Hardening

- **Key Management**: Uses OS native credential manager (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain) via `keytar` to securely store Master Key (AES-256)
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data (`token_json`, `quota_json`) encrypted with `AES-256-GCM` before storage
- **Auto Migration**: Automatic detection and migration of legacy plaintext data on startup

### Other Features

- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support (English / 中文)
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI for a clean and responsive experience
